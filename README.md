This project performs processing and analysis on r/Place pixel data.
Performs some exploratory general analytics on all the data, then uses a procedure to determine times when there was likely bot activity.

The data can be downloaded here: https://placedata.reddit.com/data/canvas-history/2023/index.html

Our code assumes the folder ZipFiles/ within the root directory has been filled with all the zipped
csv files.
